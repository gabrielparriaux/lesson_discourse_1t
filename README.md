# Teacher's classroom discourse analysis

This project presents the R code used to prepare and analyse data coming from a lesson recording.

The data is composed of the transcript of a teacherâ€™s discourse during an informatics lesson, with some comments.

It is part of my PhD project in educational sciences.

This file presents the R code for the analysis of a lesson where one single teacher is working and talking.

For data protection reasons, the data is not available in this repository. I only provide R code to give an idea of the process setup to analyse the data.
